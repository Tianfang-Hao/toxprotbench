This toxin should function as a potent neuromuscular blocking agent that specifically targets and inhibits muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the postsynaptic membrane. The peptide should adopt a compact, stable tertiary structure stabilized by multiple disulfide bridges, characteristic of snake venom three-finger toxins. The molecular mechanism should involve competitive or allosteric antagonism of acetylcholine binding, leading to reversible flaccid paralysis by disrupting neuromuscular transmission. Key structural features should include: a core three-finger toxin fold with three protruding Î²-stranded loops, conserved cysteine framework forming 4-6 disulfide bonds for structural rigidity, and specific residues in the central loop for receptor interaction. The toxin should exhibit high affinity and selectivity for the Î±-Î´ and/or Î±-Î³ interfaces of muscle nAChRs, with minimal activity on neuronal subtypes. Consider the ecological context: Wagler's pit viper employs this toxin for rapid prey immobilization, requiring fast-onset, reversible action suitable for subduing small vertebrates. The designed sequence should maintain the characteristic compact globular architecture (~6-8 kDa) with surface-exposed functional loops for receptor recognition while ensuring proper folding and oxidative stability through the conserved disulfide pattern.", "id": "3a3af37e0875103f1e54b12fe0249c65cfc2485ddf82dd2c97b545edd5048a7a", "taxonomy": "Animal"}

This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated calcium channels, specifically targeting N-type calcium channels (Cav2.2) in the presynaptic terminals of neurons. The mechanism involves high-affinity binding to the channel's pore-forming Î±1 subunit, effectively blocking calcium influx and inhibiting neurotransmitter release, leading to synaptic transmission failure and paralysis. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic cysteine framework of omega-conotoxins, with a conserved disulfide connectivity pattern (C-C-CC-C-C) forming three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The core structure is expected to adopt an inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) motif, characterized by a tight, triple-stranded beta-sheet and a knotted topology secured by the disulfide network, ensuring exceptional stability and resistance to proteolytic degradation. Key functional residues should be positioned in flexible loops to facilitate precise interaction with the channel's extracellular vestibule, including conserved hydrophobic and polar residues critical for target recognition and binding affinity. The sequence must maintain the hallmark pharmacological properties of omega-conotoxins: high specificity for neuronal calcium channels, sub-nanomolar potency, and minimal off-target effects, reflecting its evolutionary optimization for disrupting neuromuscular signaling in prey.", "id": "77549187e80539647dbb2c343958060896bd5f804759f2df4cb84a5ce9fbae3b", "taxonomy": "Animal"}

This toxin should originate from the venom of the Indian red scorpion Hottentotta tamulus, a medically significant species whose venom components are known for their neurotoxic effects on ion channels, causing severe autonomic and neurological symptoms in envenomation victims. The protein must adopt the conserved alpha-KTx structural scaffold characteristic of scorpion potassium channel toxins, featuring a compact, stable fold stabilized by three disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C1-X(m)-C2-X(n)-C3-X(p)-C4-X(q)-C5-X(r)-C6, where the specific spacing between cysteines should enable the formation of the correct disulfide connectivity (typically C1-C4, C2-C5, C3-C6) that defines the inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) motif. This ICK motif confers exceptional stability and resistance to proteolytic degradation, essential for venom efficacy. The core functional domain should include a critical pharmacophore region, often involving a conserved dyad or triad of residues (e.g., a lysine or arginine residue positioned to interact with the channel pore, and hydrophobic residues for membrane proximity), which mediates binding to the external vestibule of Kv channels, physically occluding the ion conduction pathway and inhibiting potassium efflux. This mechanism leads to prolonged neuronal depolarization, enhanced neurotransmitter release, and hyperexcitability in target tissues. The molecular target specificity should favor Shaker-related Kv channels (e.g., Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3), with key interactions involving the channel's turret and pore helix regions. The sequence must encode a short polypeptide (approximately 30-40 amino acids) with a high proportion of basic residues (e.g., lysine, arginine) to facilitate electrostatic steering toward the negatively charged channel surface, and a well-defined beta-sheet secondary structure stabilized by the disulfide core. Ensure the design reflects the evolutionary optimization for rapid onset and sustained activity in venom, avoiding any non-toxin-like features.", "id": "d325432294637609f1fe64aca2fd3c37864895fd895958afb6e11d46bbbe8897", "taxonomy": "Animal"}
