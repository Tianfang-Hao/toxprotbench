The biological significance of Conus textile venom lies in its complex mixture of neuroactive peptides that target ion channels and receptors in the nervous system of prey, facilitating rapid immobilization. The core function of this conotoxin is to act as a calcium channel modulator, likely targeting voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) or related calcium-signaling pathways, disrupting neuronal communication and muscle contraction. Its mechanism involves high-affinity binding to specific calcium channel subtypes, potentially inhibiting channel function and altering calcium influx. The structural scaffold is expected to feature a conserved disulfide bridge pattern typical of conotoxins, with a cysteine framework that may include multiple disulfide bonds (e.g., CC-C-C or similar) stabilizing a compact, folded conformation. The presence of Gla residues suggests a role in chelating calcium ions or mediating interactions with calcium-binding sites on the target. Anticipated 3D characteristics include a small, rigid fold stabilized by disulfide bonds, possibly with exposed loops for target engagement. The molecular target is inferred to be specific subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels (e.g., N-type or L-type), with binding interfaces involving extracellular loops or pore regions of the channel.
