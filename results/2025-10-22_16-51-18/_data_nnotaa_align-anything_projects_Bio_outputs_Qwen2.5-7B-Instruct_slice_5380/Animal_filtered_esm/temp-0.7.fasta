>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a protein sequence for a delta-actitoxin from the venom of the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. This toxin functions as a potent neurotoxin that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to delay channel inactivation and prolong action potentials in excitable cells. The protein should adopt the conserved structural fold characteristic of sea anemone toxins, featuring a compact beta-sandwich or beta-trefoil architecture stabilized by three disulfide bridges in a C-C-C-C-C-C pattern.

>Design a venom-derived peptide toxin from the funnel-web tarantula Macrothele gigas that functions as a potent insecticidal agent. This toxin, known as mu-hexatoxin-Mg1a, belongs to the hexatoxin family and exhibits specific neurotoxic activity against insects. The protein should adopt a stable, compact tertiary structure stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond framework typical of inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motifs, which confers exceptional thermal and proteolytic stability. The molecular mechanism involves modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in insect nervous systems, leading to paralysis and lethality. The sequence should include key residues for target recognition and binding within the pharmacophore regions, while maintaining the characteristic beta-sheet and loop architecture that defines the ICK fold. The toxin should demonstrate high selectivity for insect sodium channel subtypes over mammalian counterparts, reflecting its evolutionary role in prey capture and defense for this spider species.

>Design a venom-derived nerve growth factor protein from the Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetinus) that functions as a neurotrophic toxin. This protein should adopt the characteristic beta-sheet-rich tertiary structure typical of the nerve growth factor family, featuring the conserved cysteine knot motif with three intramolecular disulfide bridges that stabilize the fold. The protein should function as a high-affinity ligand for the TrkA receptor, mimicking endogenous nerve growth factor activity to potentially induce hyperalgesia, neuronal sensitization, or aberrant neuronal survival pathways. The sequence should maintain the conserved structural elements required for proper folding and receptor binding while incorporating venom-specific adaptations that enhance stability and biological activity in the context of snake venom. The protein should exhibit the dimeric quaternary structure characteristic of functional nerve growth factors, with the mature form processed from a larger precursor. Consider the evolutionary context of this toxin within viperid venoms, where it may contribute to complex neurotoxic effects alongside other venom components.

>Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger Î²-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core. The molecular mechanism involves competitive antagonism of acetylcholine binding to muscle-type nicotinic receptors, leading to reversible neuromuscular blockade and paralysis. Key functional residues should be positioned in loop II to mediate specific receptor recognition and binding affinity. The sequence should maintain the conserved cysteine framework and structural motifs typical of short neurotoxins while incorporating species-specific variations that confer its biological activity in elapid snake venom.

This toxin functions as a potent voltage-gated sodium channel modulator, specifically targeting Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 subtypes to induce prolonged channel opening and neuronal hyperexcitability. The structural scaffold should feature the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif with a characteristic disulfide connectivity pattern of C1-C4, C2-C5, C3-C6, forming a compact, triple-stranded beta-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bridges. The mature peptide should be approximately 36-40 residues in length with a high density of basic residues that facilitate interaction with the voltage-sensing domain of sodium channels. Key functional residues should be positioned in flexible loops between beta-strands to enable precise molecular recognition and binding to the channel's S3-S4 linker region. The overall fold should exhibit the typical thermostability and protease resistance associated with ICK toxins, maintaining biological activity despite the harsh extracellular environment.

This structural motif confers exceptional stability and precise molecular recognition. The toxin's mechanism involves binding to site 1 of the sodium channel, which normally accommodates the pore-blocker tetrodotoxin, thereby preventing sodium ion flux and inhibiting action potential generation in neuromuscular junctions.
