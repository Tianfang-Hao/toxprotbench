{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a delta-actitoxin from the venom of the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. This toxin functions as a potent neurotoxin that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to delay channel inactivation and prolong action potentials in excitable cells. The protein should adopt the conserved structural fold characteristic of sea anemone toxins, featuring a compact beta-sandwich or beta-trefoil architecture stabilized by three disulfide bridges in a C-C-C-C-C-C pattern. Key structural elements should include well-defined beta-strands and loops that form the molecular interface for binding to neurotoxin receptor site 3 on the extracellular domain of sodium channels. The sequence should encode residues critical for maintaining structural integrity and mediating high-affinity interactions with the channel, resulting in excitatory effects that contribute to the venom's paralytic activity against prey organisms.", "assistant": "MNNNNGIAKNDCDWLTALDFVKDVNGSPTHLTFYIYQKNAFLHDFGNYWVLYIELSGDFRQVPTDTFIRLCNILAVSNEYKQMGWLYIELSGGLGNEILGQHFWLTALDFGKDVVKFQGKALFQYIEKTDRFIRLCNILFGHTGQPMGAGVIVLCQNNLKLETGKNYLFLVLSDRNEMEQYAQEMKVGQCLFW<|im_end|>"}
{"prompt": "Design a novel spider venom toxin protein sequence inspired by the biological characteristics of U18-lycotoxin-Ls1a from the wolf spider Lycosa singoriensis. This toxin should function as a potent cytolytic peptide that disrupts cell membranes through pore formation. The protein should adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure that facilitates membrane insertion and permeabilization. Key structural features should include: a predominantly alpha-helical fold with amphipathic character allowing both hydrophobic membrane interactions and hydrophilic pore formation; appropriate length and charge distribution for membrane targeting; conserved residues critical for membrane disruption activity. The toxin should exhibit broad-spectrum cytolytic activity against various cell types, consistent with its role in prey immobilization and defense. The sequence should maintain the fundamental structural scaffold of spider cytolytic peptides while optimizing for stability and membrane-interaction capability.

{"prompt": "Design a long neurotoxin protein sequence that mimics the structural and functional characteristics of neurotoxin 469 from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides). This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin (3FTx) superfamily and functions as a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin. It should adopt the characteristic three-finger Î²-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C, forming a stable, elongated structure. The toxin should specifically target and antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to competitive inhibition of acetylcholine binding and subsequent neuromuscular blockade. The sequence should include key functional residues in the central loop and other regions responsible for receptor binding affinity and specificity. The resulting protein should exhibit high structural stability due to the disulfide network while maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for effective receptor interaction and potent neurotoxic activity characteristic of elapid snake venom toxins.", "assistant": "MDRITTIYGGVTLGLVITSFLGAVLWAGHTKVLDTLLDEAKKASIEGVDTKADTAATKQSAIEAFKTAKKPLENKLPEVTSKDTALKEAQKDTAPKTQEEETKSEIDTKMTSKMTSKDEMKG<|im_end|>"}

This protein should adopt the characteristic beta-sheet-rich tertiary structure typical of the nerve growth factor family, featuring the conserved cysteine knot motif with three intramolecular disulfide bridges that stabilize the fold. The protein should function as a high-affinity ligand for the TrkA receptor, mimicking endogenous nerve growth factor activity to potentially induce hyperalgesia, neuronal sensitization, or aberrant neuronal survival pathways. The sequence should maintain the conserved structural elements required for proper folding and receptor binding while incorporating venom-specific adaptations that enhance stability and biological activity in the context of snake venom.

{"prompt": "Generate the amino acid sequence for mu-conotoxin GS, a potent neurotoxic peptide from the venom of the marine cone snail Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a selective and high-affinity antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically blocking skeletal muscle sodium channels (Nav1.4) to induce rapid paralysis in prey. The toxin adopts a compact, disulfide-rich scaffold characteristic of conotoxins, featuring a conserved cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) that forms three disulfide bridges stabilizing an inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) fold. This structural motif confers exceptional stability and precise molecular recognition.
