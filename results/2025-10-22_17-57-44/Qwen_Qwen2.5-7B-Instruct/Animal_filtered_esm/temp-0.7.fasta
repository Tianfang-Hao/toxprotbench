>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a novel spider venom toxin protein sequence inspired by the biological characteristics of U18-lycotoxin-Ls1a from the wolf spider Lycosa singoriensis. This toxin should function as a potent cytolytic peptide that disrupts cell membranes through pore formation. The protein should adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure that facilitates membrane insertion and permeabilization. Key structural features should include: a predominantly alpha-helical fold with amphipathic character allowing both hydrophobic membrane interactions and hydrophilic pore formation; appropriate length and charge distribution for membrane targeting; conserved residues critical for membrane disruption activity. The toxin should exhibit broad-spectrum cytolytic activity against various cell types, consistent with its role in prey immobilization and defense. The sequence should maintain the fundamental structural scaffold of spider cytolytic peptides while optimizing for stability and membrane-interaction capability. Focus on creating a functional toxin that mimics the natural mechanism of membrane disruption through helical bundle formation and pore creation in lipid bilayers.
