{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a conodipine-M beta chain toxin from the marine cone snail Conus magus. This toxin functions as a phospholipase A2 enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, which can initiate inflammatory cascades. The protein should adopt the characteristic phospholipase A2 fold with a conserved calcium-binding loop and catalytic triad essential for enzymatic activity. As a conodipine, it likely exhibits enhanced membrane targeting capabilities compared to standard phospholipases. The structure should feature the typical disulfide bond pattern common to phospholipase A2 toxins, stabilizing the compact globular fold. The toxin should demonstrate potent membrane-disrupting activity through its phospholipase function, contributing to the prey immobilization and digestive properties of Conus magus venom. The sequence should reflect the beta chain specificity while maintaining the core enzymatic machinery required for phospholipid hydrolysis.", "assistant": "MKKKLFLLLSACSGLPPTPGKDTGFDIKGTTIYGSNIPGVVKKRQHLYDTGKLVFEELSPKEIQDYPKADTIVVPHGGWTIVTNQAHYLKDDSHSISVALKGPLDEQDYFLYNSWGARAIDGDNTASPIYAGVTMADHSHEWKKIIGDVGGYSPTDYQVVVEDTGLVYYSVDNSTQESTKGDTRTFSFVTPNAKSIVGMDIKAFGLPIGVNDGNSYFVNSTADVYKSLKELPLVTEFGLYKHDGNVYIYEARNVGDTMLQLKNEADMSDGGHYIIGPLPHNDLINYTKDGQHYYFNEAINFVVVGRDISVNSTIYKNDWGVLYVPNSGTIIFAK<|im_end|>"}
{"prompt": "Design a long neurotoxin protein sequence that mimics the structural and functional characteristics of neurotoxin 469 from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides). This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin (3FTx) superfamily and functions as a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin. It should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C, forming a stable, elongated structure. The toxin should specifically target and antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to competitive inhibition of acetylcholine binding and subsequent neuromuscular blockade. The sequence should include key functional residues in the central loop and other regions responsible for receptor binding affinity and specificity. The resulting protein should exhibit high structural stability due to the disulfide network while maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for effective receptor interaction and potent neurotoxic activity characteristic of elapid snake venom toxins.", "assistant": "MLSTQYIRRPASSYASCICCATACASCHGRNTKPSLAT<|im_end|>"}
{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core. The molecular mechanism involves competitive antagonism of acetylcholine binding to muscle-type nicotinic receptors, leading to reversible neuromuscular blockade and paralysis. Key functional residues should be positioned in loop II to mediate specific receptor recognition and binding affinity. The sequence should maintain the conserved cysteine framework and structural motifs typical of short neurotoxins while incorporating species-specific variations that confer its biological activity in elapid snake venom.", "assistant": "MDIAELLFDAAYKSNAEFSIELESQRDSKNQKDIDEALVKKIEDFPNAYEANIRNKLKEIYELQRGIEYDDLNIYSEIIPKAYQAYEANFDDSKLFRSLGDKELINVKLGQSYSGVPEVDSKLLVPTPSIPSIPSTEPSVPEIPSAEPSVPAPQSPSAEPSVPAPQSPSAEPSVPAPQSPQAPSTPEPLKQPTPELPQPEKTAQTAELINEIKMDAIKINEIMDAAIIAKS<|im_end|>"}
{"prompt": "Generate the amino acid sequence for mu-conotoxin GS, a potent neurotoxic peptide from the venom of the marine cone snail Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a selective and high-affinity antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically blocking skeletal muscle sodium channels (Nav1.4) to induce rapid paralysis in prey. The toxin adopts a compact, disulfide-rich scaffold characteristic of conotoxins, featuring a conserved cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) that forms three disulfide bridges stabilizing an inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) fold. This structural motif confers exceptional stability and precise molecular recognition. The toxin's mechanism involves binding to site 1 of the sodium channel, which normally accommodates the pore-blocker tetrodotoxin, thereby preventing sodium ion flux and inhibiting action potential generation in neuromuscular junctions.

Incorporate the characteristic methionine turn structural element that stabilizes the active site. The toxin should exhibit specific proteolytic activity against extracellular matrix components, particularly targeting basement membrane proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen, thereby facilitating tissue damage, hemorrhage, and impaired wound healing.
