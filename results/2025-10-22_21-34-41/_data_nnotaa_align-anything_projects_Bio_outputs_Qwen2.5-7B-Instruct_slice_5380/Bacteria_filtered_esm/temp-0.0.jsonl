{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.", "assistant": "MSQISTKHRTVLFRRWMAIICCLIINIAYLVY", "pseudo_perplexity": 17.379003524780273, "avg_log_likelihood": -2.8552627563476562}
{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a delta-actitoxin from the venom of the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. This toxin functions as a potent neurotoxin that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to delay channel inactivation and prolong action potentials in excitable cells. The protein should adopt the conserved structural fold characteristic of sea anemone toxins, featuring a compact beta-sandwich or beta-trefoil architecture stabilized by three disulfide bridges in a C-C-C-C-C-C pattern. Key structural elements should include well-defined beta-strands and loops that form the molecular interface for binding to neurotoxin receptor site 3 on the extracellular domain of sodium channels. The sequence should encode residues critical for maintaining structural integrity and mediating high-affinity interactions with the channel, resulting in excitatory effects that contribute to the venom's paralytic activity against prey organisms.", "assistant": "MNLQYKLNRDLRSTLTSSKCISCIMESCIMYCIMRYTPKVRSTNQVDNSVCSYNAECYVSDINNPRYEWAGTGGWRGVKANRFVYSEDDNRSPVPINQKRYADTFSLYSTLTDTIRLGKLPKAKAVSFTNGSICTMDTLKAGVSSYSTYKVCKHWRGVYTTENRVKLTGDIGNAIDYSTLADANGGTGSAATADAMSSWRGVYYTDNQVADINN", "pseudo_perplexity": 16.671066284179688, "avg_log_likelihood": -2.8136746883392334}
{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a conodipine-M beta chain toxin from the marine cone snail Conus magus. This toxin functions as a phospholipase A2 enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, which can initiate inflammatory cascades. The protein should adopt the characteristic phospholipase A2 fold with a conserved calcium-binding loop and catalytic triad essential for enzymatic activity. As a conodipine, it likely exhibits enhanced membrane targeting capabilities compared to standard phospholipases. The structure should feature the typical disulfide bond pattern common to phospholipase A2 toxins, stabilizing the compact globular fold. The toxin should demonstrate potent membrane-disrupting activity through its phospholipase function, contributing to the prey immobilization and digestive properties of Conus magus venom.

{"prompt": "Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger Î²-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core. The molecular mechanism involves competitive antagonism of acetylcholine binding to muscle-type nicotinic receptors, leading to reversible neuromuscular blockade and paralysis. Key functional residues should be positioned in loop II to mediate specific receptor recognition and binding affinity.
