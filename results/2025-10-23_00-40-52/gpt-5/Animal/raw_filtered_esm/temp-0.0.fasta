>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey.
