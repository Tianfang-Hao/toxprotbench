>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a protein sequence for a conodipine-M beta chain toxin from the marine cone snail Conus magus. This toxin functions as a phospholipase A2 enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, which can initiate inflammatory cascades.
