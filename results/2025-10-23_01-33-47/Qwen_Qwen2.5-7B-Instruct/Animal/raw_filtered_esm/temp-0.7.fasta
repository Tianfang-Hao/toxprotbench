>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a protein sequence for an alpha-conotoxin from the venomous marine snail Conus purpurascens (purple cone snail). This neurotoxic peptide functions as a potent and selective antagonist of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically targeting the alpha6/alpha3 subunit interface. The toxin should adopt the characteristic alpha-conotoxin structural scaffold with a globular disulfide framework (C-C-C-C connectivity) stabilized by two conserved disulfide bonds that form a compact, stable fold. The mature peptide should contain the conserved cysteine pattern typical of alpha-conotoxins, with key functional residues positioned in the inter-cysteine loops that mediate specific receptor binding and subtype selectivity. The structure should exhibit the hallmark alpha-conotoxin pharmacophore with well-defined loops that confer high affinity for neuronal nicotinic receptors, contributing to the venom's paralytic effects on prey by blocking neurotransmission. The sequence should reflect the evolutionary optimization for rapid neuromuscular blockade while maintaining the structural stability required for venom delivery and target engagement.
