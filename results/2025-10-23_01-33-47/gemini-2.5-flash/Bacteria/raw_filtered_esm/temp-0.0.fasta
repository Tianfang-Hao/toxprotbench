>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a protein sequence for a delta-actitoxin from the venom of the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. This toxin functions as a potent neurotoxin that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to delay channel inactivation and prolong action potentials in excitable cells. The protein should adopt the conserved structural fold characteristic of sea anemone toxins, featuring a compact beta-sandwich or beta-trefoil architecture stabilized by three disulfide bridges in a C-C-C-C-C-C pattern.

>Design a venom-derived peptide toxin from the funnel-web tarantula Macrothele gigas that functions as a potent insecticidal agent. This toxin, known as mu-hexatoxin-Mg1a, belongs to the hexatoxin family and exhibits specific neurotoxic activity against insects. The protein should adopt a stable, compact tertiary structure stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond framework typical of inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motifs, which confers exceptional thermal and proteolytic stability. The molecular mechanism involves modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in insect nervous systems, leading to paralysis and lethality. The sequence should include key residues for target recognition and binding within the pharmacophore regions, while maintaining the characteristic beta-sheet and loop architecture that defines the ICK fold. The toxin should demonstrate high selectivity for insect sodium channel subtypes over mammalian counterparts, reflecting its evolutionary role in prey capture and defense for this spider species.

>Design a protein sequence for bombolitin-2, a hemolytic peptide toxin from the venom of the bumblebee Bombus pensylvanicus. This toxin functions as a potent membrane-disrupting agent that targets lipid bilayers through a detergent-like mechanism, causing cell lysis and hemolysis. The protein should adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure typical of bombolitins, with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces that enable insertion into biological membranes. The sequence should contain characteristic features including a high proportion of hydrophobic residues for membrane interaction, positively charged residues for initial electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membrane surfaces, and the absence of disulfide bridges characteristic of this linear peptide toxin family. The structural scaffold should facilitate pore formation or membrane destabilization through oligomerization, leading to rapid cell death. The designed sequence should maintain the cytolytic activity profile specific to bombolitin toxins while preserving the structural integrity required for membrane penetration and disruption.

>Design a long neurotoxin protein sequence that mimics the structural and functional characteristics of neurotoxin 469 from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides). This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin (3FTx) superfamily and functions as a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin. It should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C, forming a stable, elongated structure.

The resulting protein should exhibit high structural stability due to the disulfide network while maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for effective receptor interaction and potent neurotoxic activity characteristic of elapid snake venom toxins.

>Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core.

Key functional residues should be positioned in flexible loops between beta-strands to enable precise molecular recognition and binding to the channel's S3-S4 linker region. The overall fold should exhibit the typical thermostability and protease resistance associated with ICK toxins, maintaining biological activity despite the harsh extracellular environment.
