>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a venom-derived peptide toxin from the funnel-web tarantula Macrothele gigas that functions as a potent insecticidal agent. This toxin, known as mu-hexatoxin-Mg1a, belongs to the hexatoxin family and exhibits specific neurotoxic activity against insects. The protein should adopt a stable, compact tertiary structure stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond framework typical of inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motifs, which confers exceptional thermal and proteolytic stability. The molecular mechanism involves modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in insect nervous systems, leading to paralysis and lethality. The sequence should include key residues for target recognition and binding within the pharmacophore regions, while maintaining the characteristic beta-sheet and loop architecture that defines the ICK fold. The toxin should demonstrate high selectivity for insect sodium channel subtypes over mammalian counterparts, reflecting its evolutionary role in prey capture and defense for this spider species.

>Design a protein sequence for bombolitin-2, a hemolytic peptide toxin from the venom of the bumblebee Bombus pensylvanicus. This toxin functions as a potent membrane-disrupting agent that targets lipid bilayers through a detergent-like mechanism, causing cell lysis and hemolysis. The protein should adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure typical of bombolitins, with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces that enable insertion into biological membranes. The sequence should contain characteristic features including a high proportion of hydrophobic residues for membrane interaction, positively charged residues for initial electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membrane surfaces, and the absence of disulfide bridges characteristic of this linear peptide toxin family. The structural scaffold should facilitate pore formation or membrane destabilization through oligomerization, leading to rapid cell death. The designed sequence should maintain the cytolytic activity profile specific to bombolitin toxins while preserving the structural integrity required for membrane penetration and disruption.

>Design a protein sequence for a conodipine-M beta chain toxin from the marine cone snail Conus magus. This toxin functions as a phospholipase A2 enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, which can initiate inflammatory cascades. The protein should adopt the characteristic phospholipase A2 fold with a conserved calcium-binding loop and catalytic triad essential for enzymatic activity. As a conodipine, it likely exhibits enhanced membrane targeting capabilities compared to standard phospholipases. The structure should feature the typical disulfide bond pattern common to phospholipase A2 toxins, stabilizing the compact globular fold.
