>Design a protein sequence for a mu-conotoxin from the venom of the geography cone snail, Conus geographus. This toxin functions as a potent and selective antagonist of voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically targeting the skeletal muscle subtype Nav1.4. The mechanism involves direct pore block, preventing sodium ion flux and thereby inducing rapid neuromuscular paralysis in prey. The structural scaffold should feature the characteristic mu-conotoxin cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) with three disulfide bridges that stabilize a compact, globular fold. The mature toxin should be relatively small, approximately 22 amino acids, and exhibit high affinity binding to site 1 of the sodium channel through key residues in its loops. The sequence must include conserved cysteine spacing and the pharmacophore essential for Nav1.4 inhibition, reflecting the toxin's role in the predatory venom arsenal of this piscivorous cone snail species.

>Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger Î²-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core. The molecular mechanism involves competitive antagonism of acetylcholine binding to muscle-type nicotinic receptors, leading to reversible neuromuscular blockade and paralysis. Key functional residues should be positioned in loop II to mediate specific receptor recognition and binding affinity. The sequence should maintain the conserved cysteine framework and structural motifs typical of short neurotoxins while incorporating species-specific variations that confer its biological activity in elapid snake venom.
