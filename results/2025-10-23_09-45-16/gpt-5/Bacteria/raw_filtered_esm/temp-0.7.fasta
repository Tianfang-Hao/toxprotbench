>Design a protein sequence for a delta-actitoxin from the venom of the sea anemone Anemonia sulcata. This toxin functions as a potent neurotoxin that specifically targets voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to delay channel inactivation and prolong action potentials in excitable cells. The protein should adopt the conserved structural fold characteristic of sea anemone toxins, featuring a compact beta-sandwich or beta-trefoil architecture stabilized by three disulfide bridges in a C-C-C-C-C-C pattern. Key structural elements should include well-defined beta-strands and loops that form the molecular interface for binding to neurotoxin receptor site 3 on the extracellular domain of sodium channels. The sequence should encode residues critical for maintaining structural integrity and mediating high-affinity interactions with the channel, resulting in excitatory effects that contribute to the venom's paralytic activity against prey organisms.

>Design a venom-derived peptide toxin from the funnel-web tarantula Macrothele gigas that functions as a potent insecticidal agent. This toxin, known as mu-hexatoxin-Mg1a, belongs to the hexatoxin family and exhibits specific neurotoxic activity against insects. The protein should adopt a stable, compact tertiary structure stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond framework typical of inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motifs, which confers exceptional thermal and proteolytic stability. The molecular mechanism involves modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels in insect nervous systems, leading to paralysis and lethality. The sequence should include key residues for target recognition and binding within the pharmacophore regions, while maintaining the characteristic beta-sheet and loop architecture that defines the ICK fold. The toxin should demonstrate high selectivity for insect sodium channel subtypes over mammalian counterparts, reflecting its evolutionary role in prey capture and defense for this spider species.

>Design a novel spider venom toxin protein sequence inspired by the biological characteristics of U18-lycotoxin-Ls1a from the wolf spider Lycosa singoriensis. This toxin should function as a potent cytolytic peptide that disrupts cell membranes through pore formation. The protein should adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure that facilitates membrane insertion and permeabilization. Key structural features should include: a predominantly alpha-helical fold with amphipathic character allowing both hydrophobic membrane interactions and hydrophilic pore formation; appropriate length and charge distribution for membrane targeting; conserved residues critical for membrane disruption activity. The toxin should exhibit broad-spectrum cytolytic activity against various cell types, consistent with its role in prey immobilization and defense. The sequence should maintain the fundamental structural scaffold of spider cytolytic peptides while optimizing for stability and membrane-interaction capability. Focus on creating a functional toxin that mimics the natural mechanism of membrane disruption through helical bundle formation and pore creation in lipid bilayers.

>Design a long neurotoxin protein sequence that mimics the structural and functional characteristics of neurotoxin 469 from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides). This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin (3FTx) superfamily and functions as a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin. It should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C, forming a stable, elongated structure. The toxin should specifically target and antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to competitive inhibition of acetylcholine binding and subsequent neuromuscular blockade. The sequence should include key functional residues in the central loop and other regions responsible for receptor binding affinity and specificity. The resulting protein should exhibit high structural stability due to the disulfide network while maintaining the conformational flexibility necessary for effective receptor interaction and potent neurotoxic activity characteristic of elapid snake venom toxins.

>Design a protein sequence for a short neurotoxin from the white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides) venom. This toxin belongs to the three-finger toxin superfamily and functions as a postsynaptic neurotoxin that specifically targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The protein should adopt the characteristic three-finger β-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with a C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 connectivity pattern. The core structure consists of three extended loops (fingers) projecting from a central globular domain containing the disulfide-stabilized hydrophobic core. The molecular mechanism involves competitive antagonism of acetylcholine binding to muscle-type nicotinic receptors, leading to reversible neuromuscular blockade and paralysis. Key functional residues should be positioned in loop II to mediate specific receptor recognition and binding affinity. The sequence should maintain the conserved cysteine framework and structural motifs typical of short neurotoxins while incorporating species-specific variations that confer its biological activity in elapid snake venom.

This toxin functions as a potent voltage-gated sodium channel modulator, specifically targeting Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 subtypes to induce prolonged channel opening and neuronal hyperexcitability. The structural scaffold should feature the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif with a characteristic disulfide connectivity pattern of C1-C4, C2-C5, C3-C6, forming a compact, triple-stranded beta-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bridges. The mature peptide should be approximately 36-40 residues in length with a high density of basic residues that facilitate interaction with the voltage-sensing domain of sodium channels. Key functional residues should be positioned in flexible loops between beta-strands to enable precise molecular recognition and binding to the channel's S3-S4 linker region. The overall fold should exhibit the typical thermostability and protease resistance associated with ICK toxins, maintaining biological activity despite the harsh extracellular environment.

The toxin should adopt the characteristic alpha-conotoxin structural scaffold with a globular disulfide framework (C-C-C-C connectivity) stabilized by two conserved disulfide bonds that form a compact, stable fold. The mature peptide should contain the conserved cysteine pattern typical of alpha-conotoxins, with key functional residues positioned in the inter-cysteine loops that mediate specific receptor binding and subtype selectivity. The structure should exhibit the hallmark alpha-conotoxin pharmacophore with well-defined loops that confer high affinity for neuronal nicotinic receptors, contributing to the venom's paralytic effects on prey by blocking neurotransmission. The sequence should reflect the evolutionary optimization for rapid neuromuscular blockade while maintaining the structural stability required for venom delivery and target engagement.

Incorporate the characteristic methionine turn structural element that stabilizes the active site. The toxin should exhibit specific proteolytic activity against extracellular matrix components, particularly targeting basement membrane proteins such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, and type IV collagen, thereby facilitating tissue damage, hemorrhage, and impaired wound healing. Include appropriate disulfide bonding patterns typical of venom metalloproteases to ensure structural stability in the extracellular environment. The protein should demonstrate optimal activity at physiological pH and temperature, with appropriate substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency characteristic of venom-derived metalloproteases that contribute to the complex pathophysiology of spider envenomation.
