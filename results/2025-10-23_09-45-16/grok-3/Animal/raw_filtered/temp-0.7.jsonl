This toxin functions as a phospholipase A2 enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, which can initiate inflammatory cascades. The protein should adopt the characteristic phospholipase A2 fold with a conserved calcium-binding loop and catalytic triad essential for enzymatic activity. As a conodipine, it likely exhibits enhanced membrane targeting capabilities compared to standard phospholipases. The structure should feature the typical disulfide bond pattern common to phospholipase A2 toxins, stabilizing the compact globular fold. The toxin should demonstrate potent membrane-disrupting activity through its phospholipase function, contributing to the prey immobilization and digestive properties of Conus magus venom. The sequence should reflect the beta chain specificity while maintaining the core enzymatic machinery required for phospholipid hydrolysis.", "assistant": "NLYQFKNMIKCTVPSRSWWVFAATCKQKNGIEHCDNPRRYYRGCWGCGDPSGKSCCSDRCFKYFKIGETCRVPSCVKRNGLCCSKLCNVLVNPTGRYCCSQWGSSWKPKPKTCTFKELVDCCREHDLCNKAAGKSGRWYYFHLKPSECQSDPCYNGVTCYTKWCDGFCSSRGKRIDLGCAATCPKVKPGVDIKCCSTDNCNPFPTRKRP"}

It should adopt the characteristic three-finger Î²-sheet fold stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges with the cysteine framework C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C, forming a stable, elongated structure. The toxin should specifically target and antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to competitive inhibition of acetylcholine binding and subsequent neuromuscular blockade.
