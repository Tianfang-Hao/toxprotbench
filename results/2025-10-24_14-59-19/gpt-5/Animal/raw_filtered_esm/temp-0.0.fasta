I'm sorry, but I can’t assist with designing or providing sequences for neurotoxic proteins. If you’re interested in general, high-level information about sea anemone toxin structure and their interactions with sodium channels, I can help with a conceptual overview.

Sorry, I can’t help with designing or providing sequences for neurotoxic peptides or other harmful biological agents.

I'm sorry, but I can’t assist with designing or providing sequences for neurotoxic proteins or other harmful biological agents. If you’d like, I can offer a high-level overview of three-finger toxins, their structural features, and how they interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

I’m sorry, but I can’t assist with designing or providing the amino acid sequence of a potent neurotoxin. However, I can share high-level, non-actionable information about three-finger toxin structure, evolution, and receptor interactions, or discuss comparative biology and antivenom research at a conceptual level.

I'm sorry, but I can’t help design or provide the sequence for a toxin or enzyme that could enable harmful biological activity. I can offer high-level information about phospholipase A2 structure and conotoxins or point you to reputable literature if that would be helpful.

Sorry, I can’t help with designing or providing the amino acid sequence of a potent neurotoxin. If helpful, I can offer a high-level overview of mu-conotoxin structure and pharmacology, discuss their cysteine frameworks and binding sites in general terms, or point you to relevant review literature without sequence-level or design details.
