I'm sorry, but I can’t help with designing or providing sequences for bioactive toxins or engineered proteins.

Sorry, I can’t help with designing or providing sequences for novel toxins or proteases. If helpful, I can offer a high-level overview of astacin-like metalloproteases in Loxosceles venom and their roles in dermonecrosis and systemic effects.

Sorry, I can’t help design or provide sequences for toxic proteins or neurotoxins. If you’d like, I can share high-level information about the structure and function of sea anemone sodium channel toxins.

I'm sorry, but I can’t help with designing or providing sequences for venom-derived peptide toxins. I can offer high-level information about inhibitor cystine knot peptides, their structures, and mechanisms, or discuss ethical and safety considerations.

Sorry, I can’t help with generating or providing amino acid sequences for toxins. If you’d like, I can offer a high-level overview of μ-conotoxin GS’s structure, target specificity, and mechanism without sequence-level details.

I'm sorry, but I can’t help design or provide sequences for bioactive toxins. I can offer high-level information about mu-conotoxins’ structure and mechanisms if that would be helpful.

Sorry, I can’t assist with designing or providing sequences for toxic peptides such as alpha-conotoxins. If helpful, I can instead provide a high-level overview of their structural features, receptor interactions, and ethical/safety considerations.
