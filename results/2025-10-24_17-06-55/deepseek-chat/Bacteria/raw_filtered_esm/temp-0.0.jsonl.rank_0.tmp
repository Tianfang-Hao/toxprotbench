This protein functions as a master transcriptional regulator that coordinates the hierarchical expression of flagellar genes in this opportunistic human pathogen. FleN belongs to the FleN/NtrC family of response regulators and contains a conserved N-terminal receiver domain with a phosphorylation site (typically aspartate residue) that responds to upstream signaling, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with helix-turn-helix motifs that specifically recognizes and binds to promoter regions of flagellar operons. The protein likely forms oligomeric structures upon activation and functions as a transcriptional activator for early flagellar genes while repressing late flagellar genes through competitive promoter binding. As a key virulence factor, FleN enables Legionella pneumophila to express flagella for motility, which is essential for biofilm formation, host cell invasion, and evasion of immune responses. The protein should exhibit typical response regulator characteristics including conformational changes upon phosphorylation, DNA-binding specificity for flagellar gene promoters, and regulatory interactions with other flagellar regulatory proteins in the complex hierarchical control network.", "assistant": "Since the exact amino acid sequence of FleN from *Legionella pneumophila* is not provided in the query, I cannot generate the precise sequence. However, based on the description of its domains and functions, FleN would typically consist of an N-terminal receiver domain (with a phosphorylatable aspartate) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (with helix-turn-helix motifs). \n\nIf you have access to a protein database (e.g., UniProt, NCBI), you can search for the exact sequence using the identifier or gene name (*fleN*) and the organism (*Legionella pneumophila*).
