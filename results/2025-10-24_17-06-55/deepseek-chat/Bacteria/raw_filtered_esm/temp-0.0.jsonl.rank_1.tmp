Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia, by replicating within alveolar macrophages using the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system as its primary virulence mechanism. Lem7 functions as a specialized effector protein that is translocated directly into the host macrophage cytoplasm through the Dot/Icm secretion apparatus. Once inside the host cell, Lem7 manipulates eukaryotic cellular processes to establish and maintain the Legionella-containing vacuole, a specialized replication niche that evades lysosomal fusion. The protein likely contains eukaryotic-like domains that mimic host signaling proteins, potentially including coiled-coil regions for protein-protein interactions, membrane association motifs for targeting host organelles, and regulatory domains that interfere with host vesicular trafficking. Structurally, Lem7 is expected to adopt a compact, multi-domain architecture optimized for secretion through the Type IV channel, featuring surface-exposed regions that interact with host proteins while maintaining stability in both bacterial and eukaryotic cellular environments. The sequence should reflect a protein capable of folding into a stable tertiary structure with distinct functional domains that enable specific binding to host cell components involved in membrane trafficking, autophagy evasion, or immune signaling pathways.", "assistant": "Given the lack of a specific reference sequence for Lem7 in the provided information, I cannot generate an accurate amino acid sequence for this protein.

BsaR functions as an essential structural protein within the Bsa T3SS apparatus, which mediates the direct injection of bacterial effector proteins into host cells to subvert immune defenses and establish intracellular infection. The protein likely contains conserved domains characteristic of T3SS needle complex components, including helical coiled-coil regions for oligomerization and protein-protein interaction interfaces for assembly with other T3SS structural proteins such as the basal body and export apparatus. BsaR is expected to localize to the bacterial inner membrane and form part of the transmembrane channel, facilitating the ATP-dependent translocation of effector proteins through the hollow needle structure.
