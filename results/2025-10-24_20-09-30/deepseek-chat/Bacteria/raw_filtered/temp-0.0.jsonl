This obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen is the causative agent of Q fever and relies on the Dot/Icm system to translocate effector proteins into host cells, enabling intracellular survival and replication. IcmP/DotM functions as an inner membrane/cytoplasmic protein within the type IV coupling protein (T4CP) complex, which serves as the central hub for substrate recognition and energy transduction. The protein likely contains multiple transmembrane domains that anchor it to the inner membrane, with cytoplasmic regions facilitating interactions with other T4CP components (e.g., DotL, DotN) and effector proteins. Key structural features include conserved ATP-binding motifs (e.g., Walker A/B motifs) if it participates in ATP hydrolysis, coiled-coil domains for protein-protein interactions, and flexible linker regions that allow conformational changes during substrate loading. The mechanism involves coupling cytoplasmic effector recognition to the secretion apparatus, potentially through direct binding to effector proteins or adaptors, and coordinating with the DotO ATPase for energizing substrate transfer.

This enzyme, encoded by the gmhA gene, serves as a critical virulence factor by catalyzing the first committed step in the biosynthesis of heptose sugars for the bacterial capsule. The capsule is a major immune evasion structure that protects the bacterium from host phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing. The enzyme functions in the early stages of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and capsule biosynthesis pathway, specifically isomerizing sedoheptulose-7-phosphate to D-glycero-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate. This reaction is essential for the formation of the core oligosaccharide and capsule polysaccharide, both crucial for bacterial survival in hostile host environments. The protein should contain the conserved sugar isomerase (SIS) domain characteristic of the GmhA protein family, with the active site residues responsible for the isomerization reaction properly positioned. The enzyme likely functions as a homodimer or homotetramer, exhibiting the classic (Î²/Î±)8 TIM barrel fold common to many sugar isomerases. Key structural features should include the substrate-binding pocket that accommodates the seven-carbon sugar phosphate and the catalytic residues that facilitate the aldose-ketose isomerization. The protein should be cytoplasmic-localized since it operates in the central metabolic pathway for capsule precursor synthesis.
