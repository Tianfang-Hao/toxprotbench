The protein should contain characteristic chaperone domains with hydrophobic binding pockets for YopN interaction, conserved alpha-helical regions for structural stability, and specific recognition motifs for TTSS apparatus engagement. It must maintain optimal stability for intracellular function while exhibiting high specificity for YopN binding without interfering with other TTSS components.

GrlR operates through a sophisticated regulatory feedback loop to precisely control the expression of T3SS structural components and effector proteins, preventing premature or excessive virulence factor production that could alert host immune defenses. The protein likely contains a DNA-binding domain with helix-turn-helix motifs for operator recognition, along with specific protein-protein interaction interfaces for GrlA binding. Structurally, GrlR should form homodimers or higher-order oligomers typical of bacterial transcriptional regulators, with conserved residues mediating the allosteric conformational changes that govern its repressor activity.
