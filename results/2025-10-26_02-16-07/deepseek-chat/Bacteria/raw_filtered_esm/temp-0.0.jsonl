Pcr1 functions as a structural and regulatory element within the T3SS needle complex, specifically contributing to the assembly and stability of the secretion apparatus. The protein likely contains conserved domains characteristic of T3SS components, such as coiled-coil regions that facilitate protein-protein interactions within the multi-subunit complex, and may possess transmembrane segments or amphipathic helices for membrane association. Its mechanism involves coordinating with other T3SS proteins to form the conduit through which virulence effectors are translocated into eukaryotic cells. The sequence should reflect a globular protein with both soluble and membrane-proximal regions, maintaining key residues for oligomerization and interaction with partner proteins like PcrV and PopB/PopD, ensuring proper needle complex formation and effector delivery.

The T3SS functions as a molecular syringe that directly injects bacterial effector proteins into host cells, subverting host immune responses and promoting bacterial survival. Pcr3 is an essential structural protein within the T3SS needle complex, specifically forming part of the export apparatus that facilitates the translocation of effector proteins across the bacterial inner membrane. The protein should contain conserved domains characteristic of T3SS export apparatus components, including transmembrane helices for membrane integration and cytoplasmic regions involved in protein-protein interactions with other T3SS components. Structurally, Pcr3 likely forms oligomeric complexes with other export apparatus proteins (such as Pcr1, Pcr2, and Pcr4) to create a selective channel for effector recognition and transport.

PilS is part of the NtrC family of response regulators and contains a conserved N-terminal receiver domain with a phosphorylation site (typically aspartate residue) that modulates its activity, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif that recognizes specific promoter sequences upstream of pilin operons. The protein likely forms dimers or higher-order oligomers upon activation and interacts with RNA polymerase sigma-54 factor to initiate transcription of pilin genes. As a virulence factor in Neisseria meningitidis, PilS is essential for type IV pilus-mediated adherence to host epithelial cells, which is critical for colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and subsequent invasion into the bloodstream.
