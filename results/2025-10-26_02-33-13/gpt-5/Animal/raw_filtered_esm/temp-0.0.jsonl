This toxin belongs to the snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) family, specifically the P-III class, characterized by a multi-domain architecture comprising a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a cysteine-rich domain. The metalloproteinase domain should feature a conserved zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) that coordinates a catalytic zinc ion, enabling proteolytic activity against extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The disintegrin-like domain must adopt a folded structure stabilized by disulfide bonds, mimicking the disintegrin fold to inhibit integrin-mediated cell adhesion—particularly targeting αβ integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3—by blocking fibrinogen binding and disrupting platelet aggregation. The cysteine-rich domain should contribute to structural stability through additional disulfide linkages, potentially facilitating interactions with other cell surface receptors. The overall scaffold must reflect a modular, multi-domain protein with a high cysteine content, forming specific disulfide patterns that stabilize the disintegrin-like fold and metalloproteinase active site. This toxin's mechanism involves dual functionality: proteolytic degradation of basement membranes and inhibition of integrin signaling, leading to hemorrhage, impaired wound healing, and anticoagulant effects.
