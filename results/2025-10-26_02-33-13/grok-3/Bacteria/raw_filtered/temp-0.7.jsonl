This protein functions as an essential structural and functional element within the T6SS apparatus, which serves as a contractile nanomachine for delivering effector proteins directly into target cells. AtsC likely contributes to the assembly and stability of the T6SS sheath structure, potentially interacting with other core components to form the contractile tail tube complex. The protein should contain conserved domains characteristic of T6SS structural proteins, including helical bundle motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions within the multi-subunit complex. Structural analysis suggests the presence of coiled-coil regions that enable oligomerization and proper sheath formation. The protein likely exhibits specific localization to the bacterial inner membrane or periplasmic space during assembly, with dynamic translocation during T6SS firing. Key functional residues should support ATP hydrolysis-dependent conformational changes and contractile mechanism coordination. The sequence must maintain appropriate hydrophobicity profiles for membrane association while containing solvent-exposed regions for effector protein recognition and loading. Conserved motifs should enable proper interaction with TssM/TssL membrane complex components and coordination with the spike protein for target cell penetration.

This organism is a significant aquatic pathogen causing septicemia and wound infections in fish and humans. VipA functions as the small subunit of the contractile sheath that forms the central apparatus of the T6SS, a molecular syringe that delivers effector proteins directly into target cells. The protein should contain conserved domains characteristic of TssB/VipA family members, including helical regions that facilitate polymerization into a tubular sheath structure around the inner tube component. This sheath undergoes ATP-dependent contraction to propel the inner tube and associated effectors through the target cell membrane. The sequence should reflect structural features enabling proper oligomerization with the large sheath subunit VipB/TssC, maintaining the extended sheath conformation in the pre-firing state and facilitating rapid contraction upon activation. Key functional motifs should support interactions with the baseplate complex for sheath assembly and with the ClpV ATPase for sheath disassembly and recycling.

The enzyme must feature the catalytic residues essential for adenylate formation and lipoyl transfer, with structural organization optimized for recognizing both lipoic acid and target protein substrates. This ligase activity is crucial for Listeria's intracellular lifestyle, as it allows the bacterium to scavenge host-derived lipoate and maintain essential metabolic pathways during infection, contributing to its ability to replicate within the harsh environment of host phagosomes and cytoplasm.

LpxH functions as a membrane-associated hydrolase that catalyzes the fourth committed step in lipid A biosynthesis, specifically cleaving the pyrophosphate bond of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to produce 2,3-diacylglucosamine-1-phosphate and UMP. The enzyme should contain conserved metallophosphoesterase domains characteristic of the LpxH family, with key catalytic residues for metal ion coordination and substrate binding. Structural features should include a compact α/β hydrolase fold with a deep active site pocket accommodating the UDP-diacylglucosamine substrate. The protein should exhibit membrane association through amphipathic helices or peripheral membrane interactions, positioning it optimally within the inner membrane for access to lipid intermediates. Conserved motifs should include the metal-binding histidine and aspartate residues essential for catalytic activity, as well as substrate recognition elements for both the UDP moiety and the diacylglucosamine portion.
