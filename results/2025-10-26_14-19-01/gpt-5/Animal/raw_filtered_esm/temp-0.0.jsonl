This CRISP family toxin should function as a key component of the spider's venom arsenal, which primarily targets ion channels to induce rapid paralysis in prey. The protein should exhibit the characteristic CRISP structural fold, featuring a pathogenesis-related proteins of group 1 (PR-1) domain that forms a central cavity capable of binding small molecules or ions. The sequence must include the conserved cysteine framework typical of CRISP proteins, with disulfide bridges stabilizing the core β-sandwich structure composed of alternating α-helices and β-strands. As a venom CRISP, this toxin likely modulates ion channel activity—potentially targeting voltage-gated potassium or calcium channels—through its ion regulatory or channel-blocking functions.

This toxin functions as a selective and irreversible blocker of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav2.2) in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, thereby inhibiting neurotransmitter release and causing profound neuromuscular paralysis. The peptide adopts the characteristic omega-conotoxin fold, stabilized by a conserved cysteine framework (C-C-CC-C-C) that forms three disulfide bridges, creating a compact, globular structure with an inhibitory cysteine knot (ICK) motif. Key structural features include a well-defined beta-hairpin and loops that mediate high-affinity binding to the alpha1 subunit of Cav2.2 channels, specifically interacting with the pore-forming region to prevent calcium ion flux. The sequence should reflect the typical length of 25-30 residues, with the cysteine pattern ensuring proper disulfide connectivity (Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys5, Cys3-Cys6) and the presence of critical residues for target specificity and potency, such as hydrophobic and basic amino acids in the functional loops.
