This protein functions as a platelet aggregation inhibitor by specifically targeting the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) within the von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding site. The protein should adopt the characteristic C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) fold, consisting of a double-loop structure stabilized by two conserved disulfide bridges (Cys1-Cys3 and Cys2-Cys4) that form the core scaffold. The sequence must include key residues for calcium-independent carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) functionality, with a conserved hydrophobic patch and polar residues critical for protein-protein interactions. The molecular mechanism involves competitive inhibition of vWF binding to GpIb, thereby preventing platelet adhesion and thrombus formation under arterial shear conditions. The structural scaffold should feature the typical α-helix and β-sheet arrangement of CTLD proteins, with specific loop regions responsible for high-affinity binding to the leucine-rich repeats of GpIb. This toxin represents a potent anticoagulant component of viper venom that disrupts primary hemostasis through precise interference with platelet adhesion mechanisms.", "assistant": "MKQHKAMIVALIVDDTAVYYCARQEGNVYYCNVKYFCWGQGTLVTVSSVGQIKVVAALYLQMGGYIGSSSLYDIAWGQGTLVTVSS<|im_end|>", "refuse": false, "helpful": true, "extracted": true}
