IcmL must form specific interactions with the Dot/Icm translocon components, particularly with the inner membrane complex, to guide effector delivery. The sequence should reflect optimal stability under acidic conditions consistent with the phagolysosomal environment where Coxiella replicates. Include functional motifs that enable selective binding to bacterial effector proteins while preventing premature degradation, and structural features that allow conformational changes during the secretion process. The protein should localize to the bacterial cytoplasm and inner membrane interface, with appropriate hydrophobic regions for membrane association while maintaining solubility for effector binding. Design the sequence to support the coordinated delivery of multiple virulence factors that manipulate host cell processes including autophagy inhibition, apoptosis prevention, and vesicular trafficking modulation.", "assistant": "MSTVKQLENLKRQLEELERQIAQLQKKLQELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQEKLEELQERLQALQ", "prediction": 1, "probability": 0.5891503758147534}

The adenylate cyclase domain must be activated by host calmodulin binding, featuring the characteristic calmodulin-binding motif that enables calcium-dependent regulation. The hemolysin domain should contain amphipathic helices and hydrophobic patches that facilitate oligomerization and pore formation in eukaryotic membranes. The protein should adopt a multi-domain architecture where the adenylate cyclase activity becomes functional only after translocation into the host cytosol, while the hemolysin activity contributes to initial membrane disruption. The sequence must reflect the characteristic features of a bacterial RTX (Repeats in Toxin) family member, including glycine-rich nonapeptide repeats that facilitate calcium binding and protein folding. The overall structure should enable the protein to intoxicate phagocytic cells by disrupting cellular signaling through cAMP overproduction while simultaneously compromising membrane integrity, ultimately leading to immune evasion and bacterial persistence in the respiratory tract.", "assistant": "MTKIKLLIILMLAVVFAQLQAQEQEVDYQGQNIRLSTNQIKQLLDKYGRPIVDTVSVKDGVTLLDSVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSSFEGQRVSLKDGVRFNTDNLDLSTVSS", "prediction": 1, "probability": 0.6527926751740496}

The protein likely exhibits an amphipathic nature with both hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments and hydrophilic regions that interact with host cell membranes and other T3SS components. Structurally, BipB should possess features enabling oligomerization to form the translocation channel, with specific motifs that recognize and guide effector proteins through the secretion apparatus.
