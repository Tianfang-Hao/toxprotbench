The disintegrin-like domain should adopt the characteristic disintegrin fold with the RGD or related integrin-binding motif, enabling inhibition of platelet aggregation through competitive binding to integrin receptors on platelet surfaces. The protein should maintain the conserved cysteine framework typical of SVMPs, with specific disulfide bonding patterns that stabilize both domains. The overall structure should facilitate the synergistic action of proteolytic degradation and anti-platelet activity, characteristic of this toxin class in disrupting hemostasis and promoting prey immobilization through hemorrhage and coagulation interference.", "assistant": "MKWLLVAVLLLCGVAQASAHETVLEQSNGLVYTKYSKFFEPKNTCPEDWSPYLGYECRYSVKCSPVTCQNKRFTNQKICSVPKKNDNAWRTKPRPSYAGVCRQALGMDLKKSHNTLYRIIMYPDLDPHYKSLVETVNDLELQIKAIMVNTHEHYGEYYPVSPNYVNSSLEKWVKHLTKLIDKGLTCSKSSKCYIMSPVPENNSFFEKSNAYVLCKNHLTKSSGLFQSPLSPNYVSHCCHHQSRLYCFKIDNSQCKSSYSGYTNAHYSGSLCAVFMMPSSWSVNDSFKCKKKSCTYKEVNYDNDIMRDILSVSTVKNTDCNPFQNSSGSCKIFEQGQVILTKSSPRTKRSLAVCTDIRSYFYKHGVTVSIKSLNSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYLNKLNSHLTKAFQEVNSGKVILYESSSDLMVRVNSSGKFVYKGDIKCVNGERIIQLCEDNIDCTNPNPCKNAECVNDNQCVCKDGTKCNNRKCVCSPGTSGKTDCSSGKDCDCKYACWNNSPTKNNHPTSCHYQSSFSKTYVKIYNGSSLYKKTNNSKRVYLLTKSSNNKFIYLGLLNPEQLTDTKCDTPKTMCPKWMSSGNYITKYNHFKMHLTKYCNKNDMCPLKSSFSKNTIHYIFGAVNYL<|im_end|>", "finish_reason": "stop", "refuse": false, "helpful": true, "extracted": true}
