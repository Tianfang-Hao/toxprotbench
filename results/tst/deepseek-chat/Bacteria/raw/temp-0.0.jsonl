The enzyme should contain conserved kinase domains typical of carbohydrate kinases, including an ATP-binding pocket with characteristic Walker A and B motifs for nucleotide binding and a catalytic domain with residues essential for Kdo recognition and phosphorylation. The protein should adopt a bilobal structure common to sugar kinases, with the active site positioned between the two lobes to facilitate substrate binding and catalytic transfer.

The enzyme should contain characteristic PAP2 family domains with conserved active site motifs, likely featuring multiple transmembrane helices typical of membrane-associated phosphatases.

PrgI should contain conserved domains characteristic of T3SS needle proteins, including a central coiled-coil region that facilitates protein-protein interactions and oligomerization into the needle polymer.
